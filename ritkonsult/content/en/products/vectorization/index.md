Vectorization means that we convert an ordinary image, for example a logo, into a vectorized file. A normal image is made up of dots and when the image is enlarged, there is a clear deterioration in quality. The advantage of a vector image is that it can be enlarged without any loss of quality. Clipart images are, for example, a common variant of vector format.

We want to emphasize that we do not work with automatic vectorization but that the work is carried out manually.

We can use a letterhead, scanned image or equivalent as a foundation.
