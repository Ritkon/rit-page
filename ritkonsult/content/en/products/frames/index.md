## Aluminum frame ALF

This is our best aluminum frame. The frame is in matt aluminum and has an anti-reflective front in UV-resistant plastic.

The anti-reflective treatment means that there are no reflections in the front from sunlight, lamps or photo flashes. Despite the anti-reflective treatment, the plastic front has very good transparency.

On the back there are three mounting brackets. So that you can choose to mount it with one or two screws.

The A4, A3 and A2 frames have exactly the same distance between the brackets on the back, which makes it easier to install. To prevent the back panel from bending, we have added extra clips. On an A3 frame there are a total of 8 clips and on an A2 frame there are 10 clips.

You can buy a [security kit](https://www.billigaramar.se/ramar/14-sakerhetsfasten-16st.html) which allows the frame to be fixed to the wall without the possibility to be removed if you don't have a [special key](https://www.billigaramar.se/ramar/15-sakerhetsnyckel.html). This is suitable for example in schools or other public spaces.

## Snap frame

Our snap frames makes it easy and fast to install and change evacuation plans, simply click the frame edges open and insert your evacuation plan. The frame is made of matte aluminum and has an anti-reflective clear plastic front.

The frame is available in a variety of sizes from A4 to 70*100 cm.

The frame is easily mounted through 4 ready-made holes that are hidden under the edges of the frame.

A major advantage of the snap frame is that it requires no preparation in the office. The service technician can keep a box of frames in his car and install the evacuation plan quickly and easily once the frame is fixed to the wall.

## Plexiglas frame

The plexiglass frame is a stylish and exclusive frame. It consists of two thick sheets of plexiglass that protrudes from the wall when mounted. The rear panel is frosted which means that the background does not have to be white, although a very dark background is generally not suitable.

The frame is available in sizes from A4, A3 to A2.
