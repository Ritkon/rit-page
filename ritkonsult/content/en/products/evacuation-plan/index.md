## Design
Our plans are designed in accordance with [Swedish Standard SS-2875](https://www.sis.se/produkter/terminologi-och-dokumentation/grafiska-symboler/publika-informationssymboler-skyltar-platar-etiketter/ss-28752019/) and are available in [3D or 2D](#the-choice-between-3d-or-2d). The evacuation plans contains evacuation routes, fire equipment as well as instructions on how to behave in case of fire or danger. If you want to include your logo on the drawing, this is included at no extra cost.

If you previously used a custom design for your plans, we can continue to draw with the same design or, if you wish, we can create a new unique design just for you.

## Range of products

We offer a wide range of different solutions and if our regular product range is not enough, we are always open to customized solutions. We deliver evacuation plans in the following ways:

- #### Finished in a frame
    Choose from [3 different types of frames](/en/products/frames) in sizes A4 to A1. The evacuation plan is printed on a plastic film that does not crease due to age or moisture and then framed before we send it to you.
- #### PDF file
    If you choose to have the evacuation plan delivered as a PDF file, you have to print and frame it yourself. This solution is affordable for those who do not need plans larger than A3 size. An A3 printer costs no more than about 2000 SEK.

    In addition to the PDF format, we can also offer Corel Draw, PageMaker, Freehand, WMF and various CAD formats.
- #### Printing
    We can print plans up to A1 format. Printing is done on a special plastic film that is not affected by moisture. Unlike paper, a plastic film never warps and keeps its shape regardless of age or humidity.

    For printing, we use Canon's latest plotter with advanced inks, which have a lifespan of up to 80 years before fading.
- #### Laminate
    We can laminate in A4 or A3 sizes. We use a regular 100 micron laminate pocket or self-adhesive laminate pockets. For hotel plans we can offer an extra low price.

## The choice between 3D or 2D { .h1 }

The choice between 2D and 3D is very much a matter of taste. 3D often provides a superior and easily understandable perspective of the premises, but in some cases 3D can have the opposite effect. A very large building of several thousand square meters rarely looks good in 3D format. However, 3D is particularly well suited to premises that have differences in level on the same floor.

{{< figure src="Utrymningsplan-byggnad-3D.webp, Utrymningsplan-byggnad-2D.webp" alt="A building drawn in 3D perspective\e A building drawn in 2D perspective" caption="Difference between a building drawn in 3D and 2D perspective" class="grid" >}}

3D drawings are drawn in a program called Sketchup. The program has a free version that can be found at [www.sketchup.com](https://www.sketchup.com/). This means that as an added value you can sell the customer's building as a separate 3D file. The file can then be used by the customer to test furniture etc.

## Our working method { .h1 }

In close cooperation with our customers, we have developed a [working method](/en/guides/evacuation-plan) that saves a lot of time for both you as a customer and for us when we draw. Through this method, we have increased the quality of the work, which means that the sending of proofs back and forth has ceased. As a rule, the first proof is correct, which saves time for the customer who does not have to send in new corrections or changes.

The work process means that you visit the end customer and prepare the drawing according to our product guide. The guide specifies how hand-held fire extinguishers, alarm buttons, etc. should be marked, how evacuation lines should be drawn and how the drawing should be divided if it contains several plans. Of course, the template does not have to be followed at all costs, but the aim is to save time for both parties. For each job, there is also an [order form](/en/forms#evacuation-plan) where you as a customer fill in information such as size, alarm number, etc.

Within seven working days of receiving the file, we will email you a proof. Once you have approved the proof, we will send you the evacuation plan.

[You can find the guide for this work process here.](/en/guides/evacuation-plan)
