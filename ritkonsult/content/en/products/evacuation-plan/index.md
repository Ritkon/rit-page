## Design
Our plans are designed in accordance with [Swedish Standard SS-2875](https://www.sis.se/produkter/terminologi-och-dokumentation/grafiska-symboler/publika-informationssymboler-skyltar-platar-etiketter/ss-28752019/) and are available in [3D or 2D](#choice-between-3d-or-2d). The evacuation plans contains evacuation routes, fire equipment as well as instructions on how to behave in case of fire or danger. If you want to include your logo on the drawing, this is included at no extra cost.

If you previously used a custom design for your plans, we can continue to draw with the same design or, if you wish, we can create a new unique design just for you.
