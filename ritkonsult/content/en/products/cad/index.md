We offer four different CAD services. 

## Paper to CAD, detailed drawing

We can convert existing paper drawings, maps etc. into CAD files.

We want to emphasize that we do not work with automatic vectorization, but the work is done manually. This means that the CAD file you receive from us is divided into the correct layers, the line thickness is correct, circles are round, the text is editable, the lines are straight, fills are correct, etc. Thus you avoid all the problems normally associated with automatic conversion.

## CAD drawings

We can draw evacuation plans, control drawings for SBA, fire protection drawings, action plans, orientation drawings, sprinkler drawings, service drawings, etc.

## Sketches to CAD

Send us a hand-drawn sketch and we will convert it into a CAD drawing.

## Paper to CAD just plain walls

For those who want to draw their own evacuation plans, orientation drawings, etc. we offer a very fast and affordable service. You upload your files directly to our FTP and within four days you will receive a file with only the walls drawn. External walls in one thickness and internal walls in one thickness.

The file is delivered in your choice of format such as DWG, DXF, EPS or WMF.

This service is great for those who want to avoid the tedious work of drawing walls and saves you a lot of time.

The price per drawing is from 100 SEK to 250 SEK depending on the annual volume.
