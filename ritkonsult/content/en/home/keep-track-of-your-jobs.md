1. We always email a booking confirmation when we have received a job that shows exactly what you ordered.

2. At ritkonsult.com, you can then log in at any time and follow the status of all ongoing jobs for both yourself and your colleagues. There you can also easily search for old jobs and download PDF files.

3. If any job becomes dormant, an email reminder is automatically sent out to you about any dormant jobs that have not been completed.
