## Design

We currently draw hundreds of fire control drawings with several different layouts depending on the customer's SBA model. Control drawings are part of the systematic fire protection work. There is currently no Swedish standard for what a fire control drawing should look like, which means that there are several different types of control drawings.

We have therefore developed our own template for control drawings where each control point is indicated by a symbol.

We usually create our drawings in CorelDraw, but if you wish, we can also deliver CAD files.

## Delivery time
Delivery time is normally within seven working days. As a customer, you also have free access to the original file and can get the files with the fire control drawings we have drawn for you at any time.

## Guarantee
We provide a quality guarantee, delivery guarantee, price guarantee and customer satisfaction guarantee. The main reason to use us is not the price but our quality and good service.

## Price

If you work with Systematic Fire Protection Work, we can offer production of control drawings at a very low cost.

## Our working method { .h1 }

Together with our customers, we have developed a [working method](/en/guides/control-drawing) that saves a lot of time for both you as a customer and for us when we draw.

The work process means that you visit the end customer and prepare the drawing according to our design template. The template indicates how hand-held fire extinguishers, alarm buttons, etc. should be marked and how the drawing should be divided if it contains several plans. Of course, the template does not have to be followed at all costs, but the aim is to save time for both parties. For each job there is also an [order form](/en/forms#control-drawing).

Within seven working days of receiving the file, we will email you a proof. Once you have approved the proof, we will send you the control drawing.
